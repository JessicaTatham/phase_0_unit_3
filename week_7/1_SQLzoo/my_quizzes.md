### Reflection

=begin
I enjoyed how repetative this challenge was. I found that after completing the required tutorials, I had a firm grasp on the main SQL commands. I would have liked it if there was a bit more of a description of each command in the tutorials while you are using them, instead of having to use a different website to explain it to you, but overall, I thought the tutorials were educational.
