## Release 0: Revisit your github.io site
What are your impressions? What do you think of the experience when compared to other websites you like? Jot some notes on what you would like to change. You can also decide to completely rework your CSS and HTML.

- go through and delete some blog posts that aren't up to professional standards.
- add content to my homepage.
- make About Me page and the Photography page the same CSS basics as the rest of the website.
- add resume to webpage
- improve Nav bar

## Release 1: Wireframe/Modify your site
You can either choose to implement Jekyll on your github.io page or you can write all of your HTML and CSS again. Make it look awesome!

You can also take this time to rewrite or edit any of your earlier posts!

Feedback

-They still haven't had time to read the blog yet.

## Release 3: Integrate the feedback
Take the feedback you like and implement it. Did it improve your site?

-I took into account the feedback that I recieved about my website and after implementing some changes, I think my website is much more professional and user friendly.

## Release 4: Deploy to a personal URL
**OPTIONAL:** Look up how to deploy your github.io site to your own personal domain!

## Release 5: Reflect on your process
Write a new blog post about this experience of blogging to learn and reflect (as well as the process of this challenge).

## Release 6: Review
Go to the blog posts discussion in the community and browse some sites. What do you like about them? Do you have any feedback? Leave them some feedback as an issue (or comment on their post)!

I really liked the drop down navigation bars that some people had on their sites, and I chose to implement one on my site. Some people have really taken the time to go back and update/improve their websites, and they look amazing. Some still haven't updated their sites since we first made them, but I'm sure after this week their will be large improvements.
