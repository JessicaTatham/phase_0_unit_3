/*
U3.W8-9: Gradebook from Names and Scores

You will work with the following two variables.  The first, students, holds the names of four students.  
The second, scores, holds groups of test scores.  The relative positions of elements within the two 
variables match (i.e., 'Joseph' is the first element in students; his scores are the first value in scores.).

Do not alter the students and scores code.

I worked on this challenge [by myself, with:]

var students = ["Joseph", "Susan", "William", "Elizabeth"]

var scores = [ [80, 70, 70, 100],
               [85, 80, 90, 90],
               [75, 70, 80, 75],
               [100, 90, 95, 85] ]


// __________________________________________
// Write your code below.

var average = function(array) {
  var sum = 0;
  for (var i=0; i<array.length; i++) {
    sum += array[i]; 
  }
    
    return sum/array.length;
};

var gradebook = {};

for (var i = 0; i<students.length; i++) {
  gradebook[students[i]] = {
     testScores: scores[i]};
};

gradebook.addScore = function(name, score) {
    gradebook[name].testScores.push(score);
};

gradebook.getAverage = function(name) {
   return average(gradebook[name].testScores);
};




// __________________________________________
// Refactored Solution

// We don't know how to make this code any more concise. :)






// __________________________________________
// Reflect

//This challenge went really smoothly. We had to revisit how to make a variable
//and object in javascript, but a quick look at w3school and stack overflow and we
//managed to figure it out. I liked reviewing javascript as I didn't feel very
//confident in what we learned the first time, so this was very beneficial.
