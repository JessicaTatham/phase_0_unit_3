## REFLECTION
This challenge was great with the basics of using git in the command line. I watched the How to Use Git and GitHub video and it walked me step by step through using the add, commit, init, and status commands. I understand what each command does, but I think it will take some practice before I feel confident using the command line to push actual files for DBC through to GitHub.
